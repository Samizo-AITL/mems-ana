**Lightweight MEMS structural analysis tools (pre-FEM).**

This repository provides lightweight analytical tools for **design-stage MEMS structural analysis**.  
It focuses on fast evaluation of structural responses driven by:

**boundary condition × geometry × drive**

The primary use case is **pre-FEM / pre-TCAD design exploration**, not high-fidelity simulation.

## Scope

- Structural stress / strain analysis for MEMS
- Simplified models including PZT and thin-film layers
- 2D and reduced-order analytical approaches
- Fast parameter sweep for early design decisions

**Out of scope:**

- High-accuracy FEM
- Full process or material nonlinearity modeling
- Circuit or control simulation

---

## Typical Use Cases

- Estimating stress scaling with applied voltage
- Comparing boundary conditions and geometries
- Identifying critical regions before FEM
- Generating figures for design reviews
